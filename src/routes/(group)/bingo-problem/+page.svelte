            <p>The bingo problem is a math problem that I have been trying to solve for quite a while now,</p>
            <p>over a year as of writing this</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>You have an 'n' by 'n' bingo board, with a "free" space in the middle. ('n' must be odd).</p>
            <p>The board begins with all spaces filled in.</p>
            <p>How many unique boards can be created by un-filling 'n' cells that result in 0 bingos?</p>
            <p>You cannot un-fill the "free" space</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The goal is to find a "closed form" (a.k.a. pure math) solution that returns the answer for any 'n' value</p>

                <p>Here's one example valid bingo board for 'n=5'</p>
                <p>(the blue ones are "filled in" and the red ones aren't)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>you can see that both diagonals have a cell un-filled, so no diagonal bingos</p>
                <p>and each column has one cell un-filled, so no vertical bingos</p>

        <TerminalComponent title="deceptively difficult" class="pt-16">
            <p>This problem is very similar to the 8-queens problem</p>
            <p>in which you have an 8 by 8 chess board and 8 queens</p>
            <p>then you find how many ways you can place the queens so that no queen is in the path of another</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The issue with the 8-queens problem is that it has no closed form solution for any 'n' by 'n' board with 'n' queens</p>
            <p>and a LOT of people smarter than me have tried that one</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The bingo problem has a lot of complexity the deeper you look into it, and it makes me fear that i may never find a closed form solution</p>
        </TerminalComponent>
        <TerminalComponent title="the first way i tried">
            <p>The first method I tried still feels the closest to working out of any of my methods, but is still not quite there</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This method thinks about the board as a collection of individual columns, where only one cell is un-filled in each column</p>
            <p>doing it this way automatically gets us part of the way there, with us only ever un-filling the correct number ('n') of cells in a given board</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I identified 4 simple criteria a board needs to meet in order to be considered "valid"</p>
            <p>1. A cell is unfilled in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal</p>
            <p>2. A cell is unfilled in the bottom-left to top-right diagonal</p>
            <p>3. A cell in some column other than the "free" space column has a cell un-filled in the "free" space row</p>
            <p>4. The remaining colums each have a cell removed from a "unique" row (meaning a row without any cells already un-filled)</p>
        </TerminalComponent>

        <!-- Going Through the Motions -->
        <TerminalComponent title="generating boards">
            <p>Let's find all of the unique ways of fulfilling the first 3 criteria</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Since no single un-filled cell cal meet multiple of the first 3 criteria, 3 columns must be used</p>
            <p>No cell can be un-filled in the column of the "free" cell that meets any of the 3 criteria, so we have to pick 3 of the other columns</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>That leaves us with 'n-1' columns that can be meet any of the 3 criteria.</p>
            <p>The number of permutations of picking 3 of those columns is the following:</p>

                <p>then 2 cells are unfilled in the same row</p>
